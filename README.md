# 🎓 Student Performance ML

Predicting final math grades (`G3`) of students using exploratory data analysis and regression models built with TensorFlow.

## 📂 Project Overview

This project walks through:
- EDA on the UCI Student Performance dataset
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Training a feedforward neural network
- Evaluating model performance (MSE, R²)
- Saving the trained model
